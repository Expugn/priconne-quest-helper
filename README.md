## Information
This is a tool to help you decide which is the best quest to farm to get
whatever assortment of items you need to rank up your characters.

`priconne-quest-helper` is based off the data from the `Japan` version of `Princess Connect! Re:Dive`.

## Regarding Current and Legacy Equipment Data
As of `August 31, 2019`, the `Japan` servers for `Princess Connect! Re:Dive` have different costs for equipment.<br>
***Some regions may not have updated to use these new costs.*** If your region still uses the old costs, use `Legacy Equipment Data` instead of `Current Equipment Data`

You can tell if your region uses `Legacy Equipment Data` by going to <https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/pages/recipe-data/> and reviewing the recipes of some items.
For example:
- Justice God's Staff
  - LEGACY: `30` Fragments Required
  - CURRENT: `20` Fragments Required
- Lion Eagle's Feather
  - LEGACY: `5` Fragments Required
  - CURRENT: `3` Fragments Required

If your region's server uses `Legacy Equipment Data`, you can continue to use the `Legacy Equipment Data` by:
1) Go to the `Settings` tab
2) Change `Equipment Data Type` to `Legacy Equipment Data (Before 2019.08.31)`
3) Save Settings (Optional)

The `Recipe Data` and `Statistics` pages also have the ability to use the `Legacy Equipment Data` if desired.

## Recommended Procedure On How To Use This Tool
1. Open the tool URL in your phone or PC browser: (<https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/>)<br>
If on a mobile phone, horizontal viewing is probably best.
2. Open up `Princess Connect Re:Dive` via your phone or `DMM Game Player`.
3. Decide which characters you want to rank up and select the required equipment (via item tab or preset tab) in the tool.
4. The tool will calculate which materials and the amount you need for you; Open up your equipment box.
5. Determine which materials you need to farm more of in your box; for the materials you have enough of, **click/tap** the material image under the `Required Ingredients` category on the tool to `disable` them.
<br>Disabled materials will **NOT** be shown in the `Recommended Quests` category.
6. A list of quests (max 10 by default) will be displayed under the `Recommended Quests` category.
<br>Decide for yourself which quest is the best for you and most cost efficient for your stamina.
