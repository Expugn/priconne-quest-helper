## Information
This is a tool to help you decide which is the best quest to farm to get
whatever assortment of items you need to rank up your characters.

`priconne-quest-helper` is based off the data from the `Japan` version of `Princess Connect! Re:Dive`.

## Regarding Current, Legacy, and Regional Equipment Data
By default, `priconne-quest-helper` will use data from the latest version of the `Japan` server. However, you can change
to a different data type if desired.

`Legacy Equipment Data` are saved states of the `Japan` server equipment data when equipment costs get reduced.
As of `August 31, 2019`, the `Japan` servers for `Princess Connect! Re:Dive` have different costs for equipment.<br>
As of `February 28, 2022`, the `Japan` servers for `Princess Connect! Re:Dive` have updated these costs again.<br>

If you play on a server that's not the `Japan` server, you can use `Regional Equipment Data` for the following servers:
- China Server (CN)
- English Server (EN)
- Korea Server (KR)
- Taiwan Server (TW)

To use any `Legacy Equipment Data` or `Regional Equipment Data`:
1) Go to the `Settings` tab
2) Change `Equipment Data Type` to your preferred option
3) Save Settings (Optional)

When changing equipment data, your available items and characters will be modified as well.

The `Recipe Data` and `Statistics` pages also have the ability to use the `Legacy Equipment Data` and `Regional Equipment Data` if desired.

## Recommended Procedure On How To Use This Tool
1. Open the tool URL in your phone or PC browser: (<https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/>)<br>
If on a mobile phone, horizontal viewing is probably best.
2. Open up `Princess Connect Re:Dive` via your phone or `DMM Game Player`.
3. Decide which characters you want to rank up and select the required equipment (via item tab or preset tab) in the tool.
4. The tool will calculate which materials and the amount you need for you; Open up your equipment box.
5. Determine which materials you need to farm more of in your box; for the materials you have enough of, **click/tap** the material image under the `Required Ingredients` category on the tool to `disable` them.
<br>Disabled materials will **NOT** be shown in the `Recommended Quests` category.
6. A list of quests (max 10 by default) will be displayed under the `Recommended Quests` category.
<br>Decide for yourself which quest is the best for you and most cost efficient for your stamina.
